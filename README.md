I have had previous experience in HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. Most of my experience was based on creating webpages.

I am interested in taking this class because I think computer science is only going to continue upwards in popularity, so it is a useful skill to have. It also inspires me to materialize ideas I have onto a screen

Other interests: history, physics, and sports (swimming and football)

In this class I would like to get a better grasp on how to use different forms of code, and I would like to create a project this year that will help teach people ew things about a subject
